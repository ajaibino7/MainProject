<!-- <p style="  margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">In recent years, chatbots have become increasingly prevalent in various online platforms, serving as virtual assistants, customer service agents, and even companions. This project aims to develop a chatbot by leveraging natural language processing techniques on the transcript of the YouTube video titled "summarisation". Despite lacking direct access to the video content, the chatbot utilizes text data extracted from the video transcript to understand and generate responses. Through the application of machine learning algorithms and language models, the chatbot interprets user queries, extracts relevant information, and generates contextually appropriate responses. The development process involves preprocessing the text data, training the chatbot model, and integrating it into a user-friendly interface for interaction. Additionally, the chatbot is designed to continually improve its performance through user feedback and iterative refinement. By harnessing the content of the "summarisation" video, this project demonstrates the potential of chatbots in understanding and engaging with multimedia content, facilitating enhanced user experiences and information dissemination.</p><br> -->
<p style="  margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Watching lengthy videos can often become a daunting task, particularly when individuals are in search of specific information or concise summaries. This not only hampers the efficiency of learning but also leads to frustration among users who prefer streamlined content consumption experiences. Additionally, the lack of interactivity on traditional video platforms confines users to passive viewing, depriving them of opportunities for clarification, elaboration, or addressing queries that may arise during the video playback. This issue is further compounded for individuals with hearing impairments, as audio-centric content like podcasts and YouTube videos poses significant accessibility challenges. Recognizing these obstacles, VoxSum aims to champion inclusivity by leveraging technology to convert audio content into text, thus widening the reach of online video content to a more diverse audience. By providing a comprehensive solution that facilitates the efficient consumption of video content, VoxSum endeavors to bridge the accessibility gap through audio-to-text conversion, concise summarization, and interactive features such as question-and-answer sessions. Through these initiatives, VoxSum seeks to empower users to engage fully with video content while addressing accessibility concerns and enhancing the overall viewing experience for all individuals, regardless of their hearing abilities or preferences for content consumption.</p><br>
